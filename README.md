## What is Created

Predict whether Alphabet Soup funding applicants will be successful, creating a binary classification model using a deep neural network. 

## Instructions

- Preprocess data for a neural network model.
- Use the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.
- Optimise the model.
